# Python Challenge JWA
This repository contains my Challenge files for Bootcamp

# Python Files

## PyBank_JWA.py
    * This file is of my own writing, with the exception of: 
        1) code and comments included in the _starter file and
        2) some code snippets taken from the AI Assistant for formatting and using 'For' loops 
    * I didn't get the same results as the mock-up on the Challenge webpage, but when I checked it against an excel countifs formula, my results matched what was found in the csv file.
## PyPoll_JWA.py
    * This file is MOSTLY of my own writing, with the exception of 
        1) The code and comments included in the _starter file and 
        2) some code snippets taken from the AI Assistant for formatting
        3) Some assistance from the following youtube video, for examples of handling a "list of dictionaries".

# Output Files 

## budget_analysis.txt (PyBank)
    * Mimics the output sent to the terminal with the print() statements.
    * Does not exactly match the expected output on the webpage for the Challenge.  This caused some unessessary troubleshooting.  I checked the script's results against excel formulas and they matched.
## election_analysis.txt (PyPoll)
    * Mimics the output sent to the terminal with the print() statements.
    * Exactly matches the expected output shown on the webpage for the Challenge

# Github
* I am still having difficulty with GitHub.  I am unable to effectly manage the files through the terminal.  
    * I copy the files from local Repository to a "working directory", and make my changes there.  
    * When I commit and then push to the remote Repo, I expect to see the files overwrite what was previously in the Repository, but that doesn't seem to happen, and I have to udpate the files manually on GitHub.
    * I am going to set up another tutoring session for GitHub, with a different Tutor than last time.
